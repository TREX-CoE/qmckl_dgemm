# QMCkl DGEMM: Native DGEMM library for Quantum Monte Carlo Kernel Library (QMCkl)

To clone the repository, use:
```
git clone https://github.com/v1j4y/qmckl_dgemm.git
```

# Installation

The simplest way to obtain the source files of QMCkl is to download a source
distribution. This particular repository is for maintainers, who write custom kernels.

## For maintainers

### Use Intel MKL for testing

```
./autogen.sh

./configure --enable-mkl CC=icc FC=ifort

make
make check
```
### Use OpebBlas or system Blas

```
./autogen.sh

./configure --enable-blas CC=gcc FC=gfortran

make
make check
```

## Linking to your program

The `make install` command takes care of installing the QMCkl shared library on the user machine.
Once installed, add `-lqmckldgemm` to the list of compiler options.

In some cases (e.g. when using custom `prefix` during configuration), the QMCkl library might end up installed in a directory, which is absent in the default `$LIBRARY_PATH`.
In order to link the program against QMCkl, the search paths can be modified as follows:

`export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:<path_to_qmckl_dgemm>/lib`

(same holds for `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`). The `<path_to_qmckl>` has to be replaced with the prefix used during the installation.
